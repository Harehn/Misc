hare Repurchases and the Total Payout Model
•
When
the
firm
uses
excess
cash
to
buy
back
its
own
stock
•
The
more
cash
the
firm
uses
to
repurchase
shares,
the
less
it
has
available
to
pay
dividends
.
•
By
repurchasing,
the
firm
decreases
the
number
of
shares
outstanding,
which
increases
its
earnings
per
share
and
dividends
per
share
.
•
Values
all
of
the
firm’s
equity,
rather
than
a
single
share
.
You
discount
total
dividends
and
share
repurchases
and
use
the
growth
rate
of
earnings
(rather
than
earnings
per
share)
when
forecasting
the
growth
of
the
firm’s
total
payouts
.
